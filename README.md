Illegal Fishing Reporter - Mobile Application Development 

 MERN Stack

This project is a web-based reporting platform designed to help fishermen and citizens report illegal fishing activities easily and securely. The system includes:

📍 Map-based reporting

📷 Image & video evidence upload

🌐 Offline report submission

🔒 Anonymous reporting option

👤 Secure user authentication

📊 Admin dashboard for reviewing reports

The solution was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Brainstorming sessions involved developers, UI/UX designers, fisheries officers, and end-users to ensure the system met real-world needs.
